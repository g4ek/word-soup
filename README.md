# Word Soup

## Description
Word soup is a game where you explore various kitchens in search of letters in drawers, cabinets, and closets while rummaging through junk. When you click on the letters, they'll be sent to a soup pot, where you can place said letters on a plate with slots to unscramble 1-2 words (hint: use the objects in the kitchen as clues). There are currently 10 levels to play through with increasing difficulty (sort of, WIP).

**Controls**
- Left Click = Select
- Escape = Pause
